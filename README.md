# Dog Party

* For Dog Party, we were required to use two different CSS stylesheets to style one HTML file.

* We were provided two different comps -- screenshots of the sites -- that we were supposed to create on our own and write all of our own HTML and then style the HTML with the two separate stylesheets.

* Once we completed both stylesheets, we could try adding media queries to our stylesheets to make our static site responsive as well as JavaScript to add some basic interactivity to our site.

* I was able to complete both stylesheets and attempt to add media queries to my first style sheet.

Here are the screenshots of my attempts:
